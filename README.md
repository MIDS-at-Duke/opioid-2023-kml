# Opioid Policy Impact
## Authors: Matthew Holden, Katie Hucker, Lisa Wang

#### Executive Summary

Over the past two decades, the United States has faced an alarming surge in the utilization and misuse of prescription opioids, leading to a profound escalation in opioid addiction. The consequential opioid overdose epidemic has prompted numerous states to respond with the adoption of policies aimed at controlling the supply of opioids and introducing harm-reduction measures. This research project critically examines the effectiveness of these policy interventions designed to mitigate the over-prescription of opioids.  

The study's primary objectives are to assess the impact of these policy changes on two crucial fronts: (a) the prevalence of opioid drug prescriptions and (b) mortality rates associated with drug overdoses. Employing a robust methodology encompassing pre-post analysis and a difference-in-differences approach, the study meticulously investigates the outcomes of three specific policy changes â€“ a Florida regulation enacted in 2010, a Washington regulation effective from January 2012, and a Texas regulation initiated in January 2007. In Florida, the implementation of a policy focusing on mandatory pain clinic registration and restrictions on drug dispensing revealed research findings that underscored a notable impact on opioid-related outcomes. Similarly, in Washington, the adoption of policies centered on prescription reassessment and preventative treatment presented research findings, suggesting a distinct influence on the opioid landscape. Texas, operating under its specific policy, did not exhibit significant changes, but there may be underlying reasons contributing to this observation. These nuanced findings not only establish a clear association between state policies and a reduction in prescription opioids but also illuminate the intricate complexities involved, providing valuable insights for policymakers navigating the multifaceted landscape of opioid control strategies.
