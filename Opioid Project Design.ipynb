    "*One of the hardest parts of developing a good data science project is developing a question that is actually answerable. Perhaps the best way to figure out if your question is answerable is to see if you can imagine what an answer to your question would look like. Below, draw the graph, regression table, etc. that you would consider to be an answer to your question. Then draw it again, so you have a model result for if your hypothesized answer is true, and a model result for if your hypothesized answer is false. (If the answer to your question is continuous, not discrete (e.g. “what is the level of inequality in the United States?”), draw it for high values (high inequality) and low values (low inequality)).*\n"

There’s no use saying “I’ll merge this political survey with medical records of who has received bad care” if the political survey doesn’t provide identifying information you can use to link survey respondents to medical records, even if you have both the survey and medical records!)*\n",
